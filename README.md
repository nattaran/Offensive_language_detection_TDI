# Offensive Language Detection on Twitter
##The Data Incubator Capstone Project- Fall 2020
### Web Application deployed at https://nasrin-attaran-tdi-capapp.herokuapp.com
In this project I used two twitter datasets. The first on is OLID dataset and the second one is hate speech and offensive language dataset. 
You can find the full description for this two dataset in the web application. 
To detect the offensive tweets, I explored three classifiers including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression and Random Forest. 
Based on the performance metrics (macro f1-score for OLID dataset and accuracy for entire data), the most appropriate model for offensive language detection will be choosen.

For the next steps of this project, I am interesed in exploring more classifiers such as SVM and Gradient Boosted Trees (GBT).
